# Restaurant Reviews App

## Project Overview

Restaurant Reviews project, is a responsive web application to view the reviews of restaurants based on the preferred location. It has accessibility features included so it is also accessible for screen reader users. A service worker is added to the application to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for your users.

## Project Purpose:

This project is part of the **[Udacity Front End Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001)**. The goal is to transform a static site that lacks accessibility into a fully responsive site that accessible for screen reader use. The site also a service worker to cache assets for offline use.

The map is generated by the MapBox API. The list of restaurants is generated by a call to a database provided for the project.

##How to run :-
1. Download or clone the repository on your machine https://github.com/RevathiShanmugam/Udacity-project-restaurantReviewApp
2. Extract the .zip file
3. Run npm install to install all project dependencies
4. In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer.

    * Command to check the version of Python you have: `python -V`
  Use the following commands based on the version installed in your computer:
     * Python 2.x:  `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or * some other port, if port 8000 is already in use)
     * Python 3.x: `python -m http.server 8000`
     * Python 3.x(for Windows systems): `python -m http.server 8000`

  * If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's   [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.
5. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`

## Changing the server portion

This app is set up to serve data from port 8080. If you have a conflict on your machine you can change the listening port in the `dbhelper.js` file:

```
static get DATABASE_URL() {
  const port = 8080;  // <-- change to your preferred port
  return `http://localhost:${port}/data/restaurants.json`;
}
```
